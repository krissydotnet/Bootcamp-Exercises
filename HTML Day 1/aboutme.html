        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a wife and a mother to two wonderful kids.  I live Northeast of Atlanta, GA in Hoschton.  I have wanted to be a programmer since I was in high school.  My first experience in programming actually was when I was in elementary school in 4-H.  I remember writing a simple program to print a picture on the screen.  Then when I was in high school I was in the computer programming elective.  I remember writing a program to take orders for movie theater refreshments.  From there I went on to major in computer science.  I received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 1999.  At that time the internet just in it's beginning stages and I received no training in college on web development.  </p>
        <p>After I graduated from college, I became the IT at the company I started working at while in high school.  It was a small pre-employment screening company. </p>
